# Captcha solver: Bypass reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, GeeTest, Cloudflare and others

Use the captcha solver to bypass any captcha.

CAPTCHAs act as anti-automation barriers, obstructing scripted workflows and introducing latency in CI/CD pipelines, data extraction, and integration tests. This solver provides a programmatic interface to bypass both visual and behavioral CAPTCHA challenges (e.g., reCAPTCHA v2/v3, hCAPTCHA) by simulating valid human interaction patterns via headless browser automation or API-level emulation, enabling uninterrupted bot operation in restricted environments.
